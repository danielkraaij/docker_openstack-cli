#### Audience
This image can be used to spin up a container which contains the OpenStack CLI tools , Terraform CLI tool and the faas-cli tool.
This image contains default values to talk to the [CloudVPS][1] OpenStack environment but these can be overruled by setting new environment settings.

#### Usage:
```
docker run -ti \
-e OS_PROJECT_NAME="YOUR-PROJECTNAME" \
-e OS_USERNAME="your-username" \
teamproserve/openstack-cli
```
>This will prompt you for your openStack password.
`Please enter your OpenStack Password:`

#### Available variables:
These variables are available. Only some of them are required as some of them already have default values.
```
OS_AUTH_URL="https://identity.openstack.cloudvps.com/v3"
OS_PROJECT_ID=""
OS_TENANT_ID=$OS_PROJECT_ID
OS_PROJECT_NAME=""
OS_TENANT_NAME=$OS_PROJECT_NAME
OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME="Default"
OS_USERNAME=""
OS_PASSWORD=""
OS_REGION_NAME="AMS"
OS_INTERFACE="public"
OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3
```
>If you omit the required variables (without default values), the container will prompt for them on startup.

#### Volume 
You can use the following syntax to  mount  your terraform projects into the container.
```
docker run -ti \
-v PATH-TO-TF-BLUEPRINTS:/blueprints \
-e OS_PROJECT_NAME="YOUR-PROJECTNAME" \
-e OS_USERNAME="your-username" \
teamproserve/openstack-cli
```

#### SSH public keys
You can use the following syntax to  mount  your .ssh directory into the container. .ssh2 is used because we do not want to alter the original files from the container.
```
docker run -ti \
-v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh2 \
-e OS_PROJECT_NAME="YOUR-PROJECTNAME" \
-e OS_USERNAME="your-username" \
teamproserve/openstack-cli
```

##### Notes
You need to provide OS_PROJECT_ID environment variable to use cinder and glance.
